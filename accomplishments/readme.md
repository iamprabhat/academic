## Accomplishments
### 1. Data Mining Specialization
by [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu/), Champaign, IL, USA.

#### About Data Mining Specialization:
The Data Mining Specialization teaches data mining techniques for both structured data which conform to a clearly defined schema, and unstructured data which exist in the form of natural language text. Specific course topics include pattern discovery, clustering, text retrieval, text mining and analytics, and data visualization. The Capstone project task is to solve real-world data mining challenges using a restaurant review data set from [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/).

#### Courses:
