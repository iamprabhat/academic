### 3. International Organizations Management
by [University of Geneva](http://www.unige.ch/), Geneva, Switzerland.

#### About the Course:
International and not-for-profit organizations present an increasingly complex environment to work in and therefore require for their successful management an unprecedented level of managerial skills on top of a deep understanding of the socioeconomic and political context they operate in. This course is designed to provide students with (1) basic notions of the practice of international relations (2) a general overview of the management challenges international and not-for-profit organizations are faced with as well as key theoretical frameworks and practical tools for managers to excel in this environment. Key areas of management will be reviewed, from strategy setting to implementation through marketing & fund raising, and assessment. (3) Given the growing interaction between public and private sectors, this course also touches upon the management of public/private partnerships.

### 4. Brand Management: Aligning Business, Brand and Behaviour
by [London Business School](http://www.london.edu/), London, England.

#### About the Course:
<b>What?</b>

The aim of the course is to change the conception of brands as being an organisation's visual identity (e.g., logo) and image (customers' brand associations) to an experience along "moments-that-matter" along the customer journey and, therefore, delivered by people across the entire organisation. Brands are thus not only an external promise to customers, but a means of executing business strategy via internal brand-led behaviour and culture change.

You will learn and practice the following skills:
- How to build brands from a broad organisational perspective,
- How to lead brand-led culture change with human resource practices at the core (i.e., brand as a lever and not just an outcome),
- How to build brands in multi-brand companies, across cultures and geographies,
- How to measure brand health in new ways, that is, internally in addition to externally,
- How to value and capture returns to brands across the organisation - introducing the new concept of employee-based brand equity - and how this is different from the valuation of brands as intangible assets.

<b>Who?</b>

This course is designed for a broad audience of marketing and non-marketing professionals, in particular human resources and finance but extending to all employees who need to understand their critical role in delivering on the brand promise. It is also accessible to students, to complement a more traditional course on branding. This course is NOT for couch potatoes as you will be challenged to do stuff in the real world!

<b>Why?</b>

This course allows you to develop the following aspects of yourself:

- <i>Head</i>. Gain a deeper understanding of the evolving practice of brand management, one that goes further than practiced in most organisations today,
- <i>Heart</i>. Be motivated to engage in delivering your own brands – regardless of where you are in your organisation – thereby creating superior value for customers and for your organisation,
- <i>Hands</i>. Translate learnings into action. As Confucius is supposed to have said: “I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.”
